# About me
Hi! My name is Sachin Thakur. I use this website to share what I've learned about software engineering and data analysis, both of   which I find fascinating. I also share projects that I've worked on to make use of the skills that I developed.

# My blog
Software engineering is rapidly becoming the bedrock of all future careers. The field's open and fast-paced nature piques people's curiosity. All of the information we require is readily available, and the satisfaction of solving complex problems on our own using techniques from the profession is enormous. This also relates to a new emerging specialization known as data analysis.

I'm interested enough in the subject to want to 'entertain and enlighten' others based on what I learn. I try to make my writing understandable for the sake of enjoyment. I try to avoid unnecessary detail and keep my explanations short and simple. Writing here also encourages me to continue learning and expanding my knowledge of the subject!

# Contacting me
If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to contact me. You may find links to my Github and LinkedIn at the bottom. Iâ€™m always committed to engaging on exciting topics!
